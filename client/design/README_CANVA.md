# GRAPTS Landing UI assets — Canva import instructions

Files in this folder:

- `landing.html` — a lightweight HTML mockup you can open in a browser and screenshot for use in Canva.
- `styles/landing.css` — styles used by the mockup (reference for spacing, colors, fonts).
- `logo.svg` — scalable logo SVG you can upload directly to Canva.
- `icons/*.svg` — small SVG icons (projects, disbursements, audit) to use in cards.
- `mock-dashboard.png` — placeholder image; replace with a screenshot of the app dashboard or a higher-fidelity image.

How to use these assets in Canva:

1. Open `landing.html` in your browser (double-click or `Open File` in browser). Use the browser's inspector or resize the window to get the desired composition.
2. Take a screenshot of the full page or of sections (hero, features) and upload the PNG into Canva.
3. Upload `logo.svg` and any `icons/*.svg` directly into Canva — these remain editable and scale well.
4. In Canva, recreate text blocks and buttons using the same fonts/colors as in `styles/landing.css` (suggested font: Inter or system sans).
5. Use the SVG icons to build cards; combine with your real data screenshots (for the dashboard visual).

Tips:
- SVGs preserve sharpness; upload them directly instead of rasterizing.
- If you prefer to import HTML directly, use a screenshot tool to capture the needed sections at 2x for high quality.
- Replace `mock-dashboard.png` with a real dashboard screenshot from the running app for the most realistic prototype.

If you want, I can produce a set of Canva-ready PNG exports (720/1440 px) of the hero, features, and footer sections.
